# Bloom 560M Training Guidelines

To customize the conversational AI, fine-tune the Bloom 560M model on curated dialogue data.
The training corpus should emphasize respectful and contextually appropriate responses.

1. Collect sample conversations demonstrating polite tone and helpful answers.
2. Remove offensive or disrespectful language from the dataset.
3. Use the Hugging Face `transformers` library with `Trainer` to fine-tune.
4. Apply a low learning rate (e.g., 1e-5) and monitor validation loss to avoid overfitting.
5. After training, export the weights and load them through the backend service.

This process ensures the model replies respectfully and aligns with the app's tone.
