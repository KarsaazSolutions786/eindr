Backend Development Plan 
Prepared By: Idrees Khan

1. Overview
The backend for Eindr is responsible for handling all data processing, task management, voice interactions, financial ledger logic, calendar syncing, and notification workflows. It is built using FastAPI and designed to support modular services, scalable AI integrations, and multilingual voice interactions.

2. Core Components
2.1 REST API (FastAPI)
Lightweight, async-ready Python framework

JWT authentication middleware (Firebase)

CORS-enabled for mobile access

2.2 Services (Modular)
2.3 Scheduler (APScheduler)
Triggers alarms and recurring reminders

Timezone-sensitive scheduling and cancellation

Background jobs for bulk reminder creation

2.4 Database & Caching Integration
PostgreSQL (asyncpg or SQLAlchemy)

pgvector used for similarity and habit detection

Redis integrated for:

Caching high-frequency queries (e.g., user profiles, preferences, reminder summaries)

Temporary session storage and token management

Queueing lightweight asynchronous jobs (e.g., habit tracking, contact syncing)

Tables:

users, preferences, reminders, notes, ledger\_entries, friendships, permissions, embeddings

2.5 AI Communication
Internal containers:

Whisper (STT), Bloom 560M (chat), Coqui TTS (voice), MiniLM (intent)

LangChain manages orchestration

2.6 Contact Sync
Route to upload user contacts

Match hashed contact data with existing users


3. API Design Guidelines
RESTful architecture (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

JSON input/output structure

HTTP codes: 200, 201, 400, 403, 500

Middleware checks for rate-limiting and feature locks based on plan


4. Development Milestones

5. Logging & Monitoring
Sentry: Error and exception tracking

Prometheus + Grafana: Metrics and performance logs

Audit Logs: Track admin and user-side backend actions


6. CI/CD & Deployment
GitHub Actions for test + build + deploy

Containerization using Docker

MVP Hosting: Railway / Render / Fly.io

Scale-Up: AWS ECS / GCP GKE + Load balancer

Feature toggles for testing via ENV flags


7. Security Plan
HTTPS enforced across all APIs

JWT auth, rate limiting, role-based endpoint access

Sanitization on all voice content and text fields

Per-user access scopes for shared or public content


8. Future Enhancements
Feature flags system for beta testing

Usage analytics service integration (e.g., Amplitude, Mixpanel)


Conclusion:
This plan prepares the backend architecture for all voice-first, AI-driven, and multilingual functionality while remaining modular and extensible for future integrations like ledger expansion, advanced analytics, and premium feature controls.
