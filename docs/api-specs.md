Backend Development Plan –
Prepared By: Idrees Khan
Owner: Karsaaz Solutions

1. Overview
   The backend for Eindr is responsible for handling all data processing, task management, authentication, API services, scheduling, AI integration, and real-time interactions. The backend will be built with FastAPI (Python), supporting both RESTful and internal services. It will be containerized, horizontally scalable, and built to transition smoothly from monolith to microservices.

2. Core Components
   2.1 REST API (FastAPI)
   Lightweight, async-ready Python framework

JWT authentication middleware

CORS-enabled for mobile/web access

2.2 Services (Modular)
Service
Description
AuthService
Firebase token validation, user session setup
ReminderService
Create, update, delete reminders
NoteService
Add, fetch, delete voice notes
FriendService
Friend invite, permissions, shared reminders/notes
UserService
User preferences, timezone, language settings
HabitEngineService
Calls AI similarity engine for habit detection

2.3 Scheduler (APScheduler)
Triggers reminders, notes, and alerts

Supports timezone and recurrence logic

2.4 Database Integration
Async PostgreSQL using SQLAlchemy 2.0 or asyncpg

Tables: users, reminders, notes, friendships, preferences, embeddings

pgvector used for similarity queries in habit detection

2.5 Internal AI Communication
Internal endpoints or service calls:

/stt/process – Whisper Tiny

/tts/speak – Coqui TTS

/intent/classify – MiniLM

/conversation/generate – Bloom 560m (vLLM)

3. API Design Guidelines
   RESTful standards: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

JSON input/output

HTTP status codes: 200, 201, 400, 403, 500

Secure endpoints (auth required by default)

4. Development Milestones
   Week
   Milestone
   1
   Setup project structure, database schema
   2
   Implement Auth, User, Reminder modules
   3
   Add Note, Friend, and Habit modules
   4
   Integrate AI model calls (STT, TTS, Intent, LLM)
   5
   Complete APScheduler-based reminder engine
   6
   Testing (unit + integration)
   7
   Prepare for staging (deployment + monitoring)

5. Logging & Monitoring
   Sentry: Error tracking and alerting

Logging: Uvicorn + rotating file logs

Health Checks: /healthz endpoint, container heartbeat

6. DevOps Integration
   CI/CD: GitHub Actions for test + deploy pipeline

Containerization: Dockerfile per service

Deployment (MVP): Railway / Render / Fly.io

Deployment (scale): AWS ECS or GCP GKE (Kubernetes)

7. Security Plan
   Enforce HTTPS (SSL termination at load balancer)

Firebase-based token authentication

Rate limiting per IP/user

Role-based API access (admin-level reserved)

Sanitization middleware for inputs

8. Future Enhancements
   Microservice split: HabitService, ReminderService, NoteService as separate containers

Caching layer (Redis) for performance boost

Queue system (e.g., Celery + Redis) for delayed/async tasks

GraphQL interface (optional for analytics/dashboards)

9. Team Handoff Checklist
   API Docs (Swagger via FastAPI built-in)

Postman collection for testing

Docker Compose setup for local dev

README with environment variables and startup steps

Conclusion:
This backend development plan ensures the foundation is clean, modular, scalable, and AI-ready. It can handle 1M+ users with gradual scaling and strong observability.
